# inspircd cookbook

Because the 90s were great, nirvana is still awesome, and
Anthony will admit this as TRUTH.

## NOTE

This is more than inspircd which is how it started out. It
provides services via anope and a web client via shout. Will
probably rename this thing to generic chat type cookbook,
but I don't really care for now.
